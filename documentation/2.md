## Overview

This documentation provides an overview and explanation of the CSS code used in the "atomazu.github.io" project. The styling ensures a clean, responsive, and elegant design, applying styles to general elements and utility classes for your UI components.

### Body Styling

```css
body {
  background-color: #f9f2e3; /* Light yellow background */
  color: #333; /* Dark text */
  font-family: "Georgia", serif;
}
```
- **`background-color: #f9f2e3;`**: Applies a light yellow background across the entire webpage.
- **`color: #333;`**: The general text across the webpage is dark, defined by the hex code `#333`.
- **`font-family: "Georgia", serif;`**: Georgia, a serif font, is the primary font family used throughout the page.

### Content and Text Alignment

```css
.content {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 2em;
  text-align: justify;
}
```
The `.content` class ensures text and other content within this container are maximally 800px wide and centrally aligned. Text is justified and has a padding of `2em` from the edge of its container.

### Button Styling

```css
.btn {
  margin-right: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```
Elements with the `.btn` class have a right and bottom margin of `10px` each, offering spacing between consecutive buttons and other elements.

### Footer Styling

```css
footer {
  padding: 1em;
  text-align: center;
  min-height: 100px;
  z-index: 999;
}
```
A `footer` element has a minimum height of `100px`, a z-index of `999`, centered text, and padding of `1em`.

### Gradient Elements

```css
.gradient_bottom {...}
.gradient_top {...}
```
- `.gradient_bottom`: Applies a linear gradient from solid white at the bottom to transparent white at the top.
- `.gradient_top`: Applies a linear gradient from solid white at the top to transparent white at the bottom.

### Card Styling

```css
.card {...}
```
Elements with class `.card` are styled with a `border-radius` of `15px`, offering a rounded corner appearance.

### Center Screen Utility

```css
.center-screen {...}
```
The `.center-screen` class uses CSS Grid to center elements both horizontally and vertically within a minimum viewport height of `90vh`.

### Navbar Styling

```css
nav {...}
```
The `nav` element has a transparent background, a minimum height of `100px`, and a `z-index` of `999` to ensure it stays atop other page elements.

### Dynamic Content Expansion/Collapsing

```css
.card-full-content {...}
.card-full-content.expanded {...}
```
`.card-full-content` and `.card-full-content.expanded` are utilized for creating expanding/collapsing content effects, adapting content visibility smoothly.

### Image Styling

```css
.img-c {...}
.img-sm, .img-me, .img-la {...}
.img-le, .img-ri, .img-ce {...}
```
- `.img-c`: A utility class offering common image styling.
- Different size classes (`img-sm`, `img-me`, `img-la`) are available to apply predetermined width and height.
- Positioning classes (`img-le`, `img-ri`, `img-ce`) are used to align images to the left, right, or center, respectively.

### Fading Effect

```css
.fade {...}
```
Elements with the `.fade` class will have an opacity transition effect over a duration of `2s`.

### Mobile Responsiveness

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {...}
```
The included mobile styles optimize the UI/UX for screens with a max-width of `768px`. Various properties are overridden to adapt layouts, spacing, and element sizes for mobile screens.

## Usage Example

Here is an example of how to utilize these styles in your HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path-to-your-css-file.css">
</head>
<body>
    <nav>
        <!-- Navbar Content -->
    </nav>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Your main content goes here...</p>
        <button class="btn">Click me</button>
    </div>
    <footer>
        <!-- Footer Content -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
Replace `"path-to-your-css-file.css"` with the actual path to your CSS file.
