### 1. Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

Dynamic blog loading allows for improving webpage performance by only loading the blog content as and when it is needed. By utilizing Markdown, we enhance content management by separating the content creation and design, making it simpler and more efficient.

### 2. Requirements<a name="requirements"></a>

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Familiarity with Markdown syntax.
- A text editor and a browser for testing.

### 3. Implementation<a name="implementation"></a>

- **Step 1:** Use JavaScript to fetch your Markdown files.
- **Step 2:** Utilize a Markdown parser (e.g., Marked.js) to convert your Markdown to HTML dynamically.
- **Step 3:** Inject the generated HTML into your webpage dynamically.
- **Step 4:** Apply CSS for styling as per requirement.

**Example Code:**

```javascript
fetch(`./blog-posts/${i}.md`)
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(markdown => {
    const contentHtml = marked(markdown);
    // Inject HTML into your webpage...
  });
```

### 4. Markdown Structure<a name="markdown-structure"></a>

Use front matter for meta-information and Markdown for content, replace `---` with the unicode `U+2E3B`:

```markdown
---
title: Your Blog Title
teaser: A short teaser of your blog post.
---

## Your Blog Heading

Your blog content goes here...
```

### 5. Styling Images in Markdown<a name="styling-images"></a>

To style images, use inline HTML within your Markdown content. Specify the class and/or style directly:

```markdown
<img src="your-image-source" alt="alt-text" class="your-class">
```

### 6. Troubleshooting<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

- **Issue:** Markdown not rendering - Ensure that the path to your Markdown file is correct and the file exists.
- **Issue:** Styling not being applied - Make sure that your CSS is correctly linked and the classes are correctly spelled and applied.
