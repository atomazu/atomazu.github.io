        <p>Hey there! I'm Jonas, and this is my little spot on the web.</p>
        <img src="./cover_image.jpg" alt="Quest for Knowledge"
          class="img-c img-la img-le">
        <p>I'm a pretty laid-back guy who's into computer science. I'm no expert, but I find it really interesting to
          learn about all the cool stuff that's out there. It's amazing to see how far we've come and to think about the
          people who have made it all possible.</p>
        <p>This website is kind of like my online journal. It's a place where I can share my thoughts and keep track of
          what I'm learning. I know I've got a lot to learn, and I'm okay with that. Every mistake is a chance to grow,
          right?</p>
        <p>As I explore this whole computer science thing, I'm hoping to understand more about the world around me. I'm
          just taking it one day at a time and enjoying the ride.</p>
        <p>Feel free to check out my blog, where I talk about my adventures in programming, writing, and gaming. It's
          nothing fancy, just a reflection of my journey. Maybe you'll find something that clicks with you.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">What I'm Into</h2>
        <p>I'm really into stuff that makes me think and solve problems. It could be anything from coding to research or
          anything else that gets my brain working.</p>
        <p>I love a good challenge. Every problem is a chance to learn something new, and that's what keeps me going.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the things I'm into:</p>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">Figuring out how to make cool software</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Working on projects that help people out</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Diving into research about things that make me curious</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Helping others and learning from them too</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Always trying to improve my skills and learn new things</li>
        </ul>
