#### The Philosophical Underpinnings: 17th Century

The journey begins in the 17th century with philosophers like [Leibniz](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz) and [Descartes](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes), who envisioned theoretical codes for translating words between languages. This period laid the philosophical groundwork for machine translation, conceptualizing language as a system that could potentially be codified.

#### Early Mechanizations: Mid-1930s

Fast forward to the mid-1930s, when the first patents for "translating machines" were applied for by Georges Artsrouni and Peter Troyanskii. These initial attempts at automating language translation highlighted the tangible interest in bridging linguistic gaps through mechanization.

#### The Turing Test: 1950

The mid-20th century brought forth the [Turing Test](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), introduced by [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence) in his seminal paper "[Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence)". This era marked a significant step towards blending computation and language understanding, considering natural language processing as a measure of machine intelligence.

#### The Georgetown Experiment: 1954

Machine translation took a notable leap with the [Georgetown Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown%E2%80%93IBM_experiment) in 1954, translating over sixty Russian sentences into English. This experiment sparked optimism (perhaps overly so) about the future of machine translation.

#### Universal Grammar: 1957

[Noam Chomsky's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky) "[Syntactic Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_Structures)" introduced the concept of 'universal grammar,' revolutionizing both linguistics and computational models for language.

#### The Birth of NLP: 1960s Onwards

The subsequent decades, starting from the 1960s, witnessed the emergence and evolution of various technologies and models that laid the foundation for modern NLP:
- **SHRDLU**: A breakthrough in restricted natural language understanding within defined "blocks worlds." ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU))
- **Conceptual Dependency Theory**: Roger Schank introduced a new way to conceptualize natural language understanding. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_dependency_theory))
- **Statistical Machine Translation**: The late 1980s and early 2000s saw the shift towards statistical models for machine translation, revitalizing the domain after a period of stagnation. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_machine_translation))

#### The Era of Neural Networks and Embeddings: 2000s to Present

The new millennium brought forth innovations that leveraged neural networks and word embeddings:
- **Word2Vec**: Tomáš Mikolov and co-authors introduced this method, popularizing word embeddings in NLP. ([Source](https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/28b132b4b7e82cfb538fd462887ba98b8/florianpircher))
- **Neural Language Models**: Models like the one introduced by Yoshua Bengio began to outperform traditional word n-gram models. ([Source](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v3/bengio03a))
- **Seq2Seq Models**: Ilya Sutskever and team generalized the approach for various sequence-based tasks in NLP. ([Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215))

#### Transformers and Pre-trained Models: 2010s Onwards

In more recent years, models like BERT from Google and GPT-2/3 from OpenAI have showcased the remarkable capabilities of large-scale language models in generating human-like text. The field has witnessed a surge in multi-modal understanding, combining vision and language, as seen in models like CLIP.
- **BERT**: Introduced by Google, BERT sets new standards for several NLP benchmarks. ([Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805))
- **GPT-2**: Known for its high-quality text generation. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-2))
- **GPT-3**: Further improves the capabilities of language models, opening up new possibilities for NLP applications. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3))
- **CLIP**: Marks a step towards multi-modal understanding, combining vision and language. ([Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05796))

#### Reflections and Future Directions

Embarking on this exploration of language and machines elucidated not only the technological advancements but also the amalgamation of various disciplines – linguistics, computer science, and cognitive psychology, to name a few.

The field of NLP, as it stands today, is a testament to centuries of curiosity and decades of rigorous research and development. Yet, the journey doesn’t end here. The future holds the promise of further breakthroughs, perhaps achieving truly conversational AI, comprehending the depths of semantics, or even understanding the nuances of human emotions expressed through language.
