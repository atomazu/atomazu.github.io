This change wasn't impulsive. I spent an afternoon with the aim to refresh my website and start this blog. Now, it's done!

For better user experience, I used JavaScript to enable dynamic loading. I'm pleased with the outcome. The design is clean, animations are smooth, and the book-like style ties it all together.

The 'book' style is a highlight for me. It's visually comforting and adds an elegant touch. It reminds me of Claude's website, which I've always enjoyed.

With the blog now live, you can look forward to diverse contentâ€”from coding tutorials to my insights on different subjects. I'm excited for what's to come.
