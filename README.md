# atomazu.github.io

Welcome to the source code repository for [atomazu.github.io](https://atomazu.github.io), a personal website serving as a digital portfolio and information hub.

## Website Overview

This website is a showcase of my projects, interests, and writings. It's a place where I share my experiences, knowledge, and creativity with the world.

## Website Content

- **Home Page (`index.html`):** Get an overview of my interests, projects, and skills.
- **Blog (`blog.html`):** Explore my articles and writings on various topics, from technology to personal growth.
- **KanjiWizard (`kanjiwizard.html`):** Coming soon! A project dedicated to helping people learn and master Japanese kanji characters.
- **404 Page (`not_found.html`):** A custom error page for when you stumble upon a non-existent URL.

## Features

- **Theme Toggle:** Switch between light and dark themes with a click. Your preferred theme is saved in local storage for a seamless experience across sessions.
- **Scroll Effects:** Content fades in as you scroll down the page, creating a smooth and engaging user experience.
- **Quick Navigation:** Easily access different sections of the homepage with our intuitive navigation system.

## JavaScript Functionality

This website uses vanilla JavaScript to provide an interactive and dynamic experience:

- `theme-toggle.js`: Handles theme switching and local storage.
- `fade-effect.js`: Manages the fade-in effect for content as you scroll.

By using vanilla JavaScript, we've kept the website lightweight and fast, without relying on heavy frameworks.
